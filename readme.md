What we discovered was a systemic, ruthless plan to undermine the
quality of life of millions of Americans, remove critical protections
and dismantle programs for communities across the nation, and prioritize
special interests and ideological extremism over people.

From attacking overtime pay, student loans, and reproductive rights, to
allowing more discrimination, pollution, and price gouging, those behind
Project 2025 are preparing to go to incredible lengths to create a
country only for some, not for all of us.

If these plans are enacted, even without congressional approval, **4.3
million people** could lose overtime protections, **40 million people**
could have their food assistance reduced, **220,000 American jobs**
could be lost, and much, much, more. The stakes are higher than ever for
democracy and for people.

> **These threats aren't hypothetical. These are their real plans.**

![](./images/media/image5.png){width="7.5in" height="4.62in"}The
Heritage Foundation and the 100+ organizations that make up the Project
2025 Advisory Board have mapped out exactly how they will achieve their
extreme ends. They aim to carry out many of the most troubling proposals
through an anti-democratic president and political loyalists installed
in the executive branch, without waiting for congressional action. And,
while many of these plans are unlawful, winning in court is not
guaranteed given that the same far-right movement that is behind Project
2025 has shaped our current court system.

What follows are some of the most dangerous proposals that make up
Project 2025, specifically those that could be implemented through
federal agencies and a farright executive branch.

Workplaces,

and Destabilize

Our Economy

**Their proposals will:**

democracyforward.org

Destabilize Our Economy

Project 2025 would enable

corporations

to cut overtime

pay, relax worker safety

rules, allow workplace

discrimination

, and more.

**How they'd do it:**

Stop people from earning overtime pay.

Project 2025

wants the Department of Labor to make it harder for

people to earn overtime pay.

**1**

In 2024, the Biden administration issued a policy that will make over
[**[four million]{.underline}**
**[workers]{.underline}**](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-labor-department-overtime-pay-expansion-who-qualifies-cbs-news-explains/#:~:text=About%204.3%20million%20U.S.%20workers,rule%20from%20the%20Biden%20administration.)
newly eligible to qualify for overtime pay. The U.S. Department of Labor
did this by raising the "overtime threshold," which is the salary
ceiling under which salaried workers still qualify automatically for
overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours in a week, even though
those workers are not paid hourly. Raising the overtime threshold
increases the number of workers with guaranteed overtime protections.
Currently, the threshold protects non-hourly workers who make up to
\$43,888 annually, and it's set to rise again in 2025 to apply to people
making up to \$58,656.

Project 2025 doesn't want to raise this threshold. Instead, Project 2025
proposes lowering the threshold and taking away overtime eligibility for
millions of workers. This would leave at least four million working
people in industries that pay annually but still at lower wages stuck
working long hours without overtime pay --- everything from hospitality
to manufacturing, administrative roles, and more.

***From Mandate for Leadership p. 492***

**How they'd do it:**

Cut funding for local job-creating programs.

Project 2025 proposes to destroy a program that

plays a pivotal role in facilitating transformative

economic growth for local economies.

**2**

The Economic Development Administration (EDA) was responsible for
investing billions of ARP dollars into transformative infrastructure
projects across the nation. According to their 2022
[**[report]{.underline}**](https://www.eda.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/FY2022-Approved-EDA-Annual-Report.pdf),
these investments resulted in 220,000 jobs and generated nearly \$20
billion in private investment.

Project 2025 proposes that EDA grants "should be consolidated with other
programs and/or eliminated," which would undermine the ability of the
federal government to invest in communities across the nation --- with
effects that could devastate working people, small businesses, and the
overall health of our economy.

***From Mandate for Leadership p. 664***

**3 How they'd do it:**

> Manipulate data that businesses rely on to keep our economy
> functioning. By consolidating the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Census
> Bureau, and Bureau of Labor Statistics, Project 2025 would kneecap the
> data-collection capacities of these important agencies --- with
> effects felt by working people across the nation.

Data compiled by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is
[**[intentionally]{.underline}**
**[independent]{.underline}**](https://www.bls.gov/blog/2020/planning-bls-strategy-for-2025-and-beyond.htm)
from partisan interests and is frequently relied on by the public,
employers, researchers, and government organizations. According to
[**[BLS]{.underline}**,](https://www.bls.gov/audience/#:~:text=We%20measure%20employment%2C%20compensation%2C%20worker,at%20work%20and%20at%20home.)
they "measure employment, compensation, worker safety, productivity, and
price movements. This information is used by jobseekers, workers,
business leaders, and others to help them make sound decisions at work
and at home."

Project 2025, however, wants to consolidate the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis and Census Bureau with BLS into one agency. While formal
reorganization
[**[requires]{.underline}**](https://ballotpedia.org/Executive_branch_reorganization_authority)
explicit delegation from Congress to go through, the Trump
administration made an
[**[attempt]{.underline}**](https://ballotpedia.org/Trump_administration_proposed_executive_branch_reorganization)
in 2018 to bypass Congress and use other executive powers to do so. If
an extremist were to occupy the executive branch again, Project 2025
would want them to go even further.

Politicizing BLS and reducing the data collection capacity of the agency
by consolidating it into the Census Bureau would make it harder to know
how our economy is doing, whether families' paychecks are growing, and
what steps we may need to take to make sure small businesses are
thriving and people have enough in their bank accounts to make ends
meet.

**How they'd do it:**

Weaken child labor protections.

Project 2025 would

amend hazard regulations to allow employers to put

young people in unsafe working conditions.

**4**

The authors of Project 2025 think that young people should be able to
work in "inherently dangerous jobs," in roles that are currently not
permitted due to significant safety concerns that have long been
established and enforced by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL).

Project 2025 would change DOL policies and allow America's youth to work
these jobs, meaning young people entering the labor force out of
economic necessity could be subjected to more dangerous work because
they need the income more than others --- and cannot access a safer job
or get paid as well.

**In their own words:**

Hazard-Order

Regulations. Some young adults

show an interest in inherently

dangerous jobs. Current rules forbid

many young people, even if their

family is running the business, from

working in such jobs. This results in

worker shortages in dangerous fields

and often discourages otherwise

interested young workers from trying

the more dangerous job.

Project 2025

would make it harder for people to access food

and reevaluating important programs.

***From Mandate for Leadership p. 299 & 300***

**How they'd do it:**

Eliminate the Head Start program.

Project 2025

would destroy a program that is critical to

uplifting children across the nation from lower

socioeconomic backgrounds.

**2**

Head Start is a critical program that helps over [**[one million
children]{.underline}**](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ohs/about#:~:text=Head%20Start%20and%20Early%20Head%20Start%20grant%20recipients%20provide%20services,more%20than%20155%20tribal%20communities.)
across the nation become ready for school by providing them with mental,
emotional, and social support programming. This program provides
targeted assistance to lowincome children as an important method to
bridge inequities and ensure that all children receive a solid
foundation as they embark on their educational journey.

![](./images/media/image10.png){width="4.06in"
height="3.6233333333333335in"}Project 2025 proposes to eliminate the
program. Without Head Start, families who are already struggling
financially could experience even greater economic burdens as they would
have to spend more on childcare and education.

***From Mandate for Leadership***

***p. 649-650***

***From Mandate for Leadership page 482***

**How they'd do it:**

Limit which disabilities qualify veterans for benefits.

The authors of Project 2025 think that too many

veterans qualify for disability benefits.

**3**

Disability benefits are often critical lifelines for veterans who became
disabled as a result of their military service --- and can be the
difference between a veteran being able to put food on the table or not"

Project 2025 proposes to have the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
cut costs by having fewer health conditions qualify veterans for
disability benefits --- a proposal could greatly restrict disabled
veterans' access to lifesustaining benefits.

**How they'd do it:**

Remove safety nets for farmers.

Project 2025 thinks

that farmers are receiving too much assistance.

**4**

The people who put food on our tables and ensure our communities get fed
are often subject to the whims of unpredictable weather patterns and
market conditions. This means that while some years a farmer may be
doing great, the next they could be on the brink of economic failure.
That's where safety nets come in.

![](./images/media/image11.png){width="2.4266666666666667in"
height="3.2333333333333334in"}Project 2025 wants to restrict safety nets
for farmers to 'unusual situations' --- even though we know that the
difficult conditions farmers experience are not unusual but common. A
restriction of assistance to farmers would disparately impact low-income
farmers and those without extensive assets to fall back on when things
go awry.

***From Mandate for Leadership p. 297***

**How they'd do it:**

Eliminate funding for key public transportation

projects.

Despite its transformational investments in

communities across the U.S., the Capital Investment

Grants (CIG) program is a Project 2025 target for

elimination.

**5**

The CIG program plays an important role in awarding federal grants to
local communities in order to fund infrastructure projects. After the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was passed in 2021, CIG was responsible
for awarding
[**[billions]{.underline}**](https://www.transit.dot.gov/funding/grants/fact-sheet-capital-investment-grants-program)
of dollars for key public transportation projects across the country.

![](./images/media/image12.png){width="7.5033344269466316in"
height="6.223333333333334in"}Project 2025 wants to eliminate CIG, which
could make it much harder for Americans without cars to get to work and
travel around town --- to work or just to be with family and friends.

> drug prices high, and restrict access to reproductive care.

**How they'd do it:**

Keep the cost of lifesaving medication too high.

Project 2025 would undo Medicare's new ability

to negotiate lower prescription prices for seniors.

**1**

Medicare's new ability to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for
seniors, established through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), will be
transformative for millions of seniors in the United States.

![](./images/media/image14.png){width="2.88in"
height="6.4233344269466315in"}[**[According
to]{.underline}**](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/5-facts-to-know-about-medicare-drug-price-negotiation/)
the Center for American Progress, these negotiations are targeting some
of the most expensive drugs frequently used by seniors, saving hundreds
of thousands of dollars in drug costs each year. These negotiations are
also critical for advancing health equity, given that many of the
prescriptions targeted by the negotiations treat conditions
[**[disparately
experienced]{.underline}**](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/5-facts-to-know-about-medicare-drug-price-negotiation/)
by people who have historically experienced marginalization because of
their race or gender.

While Project 2025's plan is to specifically instruct Congress to repeal
this part of the IRA, they could also easily advise the Department of
Justice (DOJ) to stop defending Medicare's ability to negotiate drug
prices in courts, where the program currently faces [**[numerous
challenges]{.underline}**](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/01/politics/medicare-drug-price-negotiation-astrazeneca/index.html).

Project 2025's attacks on Medicare's ability to negotiate drug prices
would negatively impact millions of elderly Americans, particularly
elderly people of color and those with low incomes.

# From Mandate for Leadership p. 465

**2 How they'd do it:**

> End medication abortion use, or make it incredibly difficult to
> access. Project 2025 would revoke approval from the U.S. Food and Drug
> Administration (FDA), criminalize mailing medication abortion, or even
> enlist the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as part of their
> anti-abortion efforts.

Over two decades of medical practice show that mifepristone ---
medication abortion --- is safe and effective. In fact, just last year,
[**[nearly
two-thirds]{.underline}**](https://www.guttmacher.org/2024/03/medication-abortion-accounted-63-all-us-abortions-2023-increase-53-2020)
of all pregnant people relied on medication abortion for their abortion
care. This is one of the last lifelines for millions of pregnant people
across the United States, as many state governments are ramping up
attacks.

The anti-abortion extremists behind Project 2025, not content with
merely overturning *Roe v. Wade*, want to attack access to medication
abortion nationwide by any means necessary.

a.  *Project 2025 would weaponize the long-dormant Comstock Act to try
    and make the delivery of medication abortion by mail illegal.*

Originally passed in the 19th century to restrict the types of things
that could be mailed, the *Comstock Act* is, today, in District Court
Judge Robert Chambers' own words: a "widely abrogated 19th century
statute."

Despite the DOJ, the courts, and Congress already making clear that the
*Comstock Act* does not apply to legal abortion care, Project 2025 plans
to weaponize the DOJ and resurrect this Act to ban nationwide medication
abortion access.

***From Mandate for Leadership p. 562***

b.  *Project 2025 would have the FDA reverse approval of this safe and
    effective medication.*

Reversing federal approval of medication abortion could deprive people
of essential health care, even in states where abortion remains legal.
In states where abortion

is banned or restricted, this would further subject people to the whims
of state legislatures, many of which have actively [**[pushed or
enacted]{.underline}**](https://www.guttmacher.org/2023/12/state-policy-trends-2023-first-full-year-roe-fell-tumultuous-year-abortion-and-other)
abortion restrictions since the Supreme Court overturned *Roe v. Wade*.

***From Mandate for Leadership p. 458***

c.  *Project 2025 would further undermine medication abortion by mail by
    reimposing unnecessary and burdensome requirements that mifepristone
    be dispensed in person and by a doctor.*

Post-*Dobbs*, the FDA has played an important role by allowing the
distribution of mifepristone by mail and at certain pharmacies. This has
allowed increased access to care, given that not everyone has the
privilege of convenient in-person doctor access. If these plans were
implemented, it will become harder for everyone to access abortion care,
particularly low-income pregnant people and those in rural communities.

> **In their own words:** A bare-minimum policy of limiting abortion
> pills to the pre-2016 policy of 49 days gestation, returning to the
> pre-2021 inperson dispensing requirement, and returning to requiring
> prescribers to report all serious adverse events, not just deaths, to
> the drug sponsor would increase women's health and safety."

# Mandate for Leadership p. 459

> **d.** *If all else fails, Project 2025 would turn to the EPA to apply
> restrictive regulations to medication abortion.*

*Project 2025 wants an anti-democratic president to direct the EPA to
classify medication abortion as containing 'forever chemicals' --- which
are subject to stricter regulations. If the EPA were to classify
medication abortion as a "forever chemical," it would stifle the
approval and distribution of medication abortion.*

[***[According to Politico's 'Anti-abortion forces plan for a Trump
return':]{.underline}***](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-pulse/2024/01/30/anti-abortion-forces-plan-for-a-trump-return-00138398)

**In their own words:**

Using the EPA to classify the chemicals in abortion

pill mifepristone as "forever chemicals" subject to stricter
regulations.

"

**How they'd do it:**

Push people towards private Medicare plans

that worsen health outcomes.

Under the guise

of allowing greater choice, Project 2025 would

push policies that favor private, worse-performing

alternatives to Medicare.

**3**

While many of Project 2025's plans for Medicare require congressional
action, they also encourage a future administration to use all possible
levers, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS),
to alter this critical program however they can.

Several of their proposals would push people towards private Medicare
alternatives, which are not real alternatives at all --- with
[**[reports]{.underline}**](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/rejecting-claims-medicare-advantage-rural-hospitals-rcna121012)
showing that "Medicare Advantage plans threaten rural hospitals and
patients" and
[**[misled]{.underline}**](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/03/upshot/private-medicare-misleading-marketing.html)
people into signing up for them. While Project 2025 may pitch these
Medicare 'reforms' as encouraging consumer choice, in reality they will
leave seniors worse off across the country --- putting the health of
many of the [**[33 million people enrolled in traditional]{.underline}**
**[Medicare]{.underline}**](https://medicareadvocacy.org/medicare-enrollment-numbers/#:~:text=The%20Centers%20for%20Medicare%20%26%20Medicaid,are%20enrolled%20in%20Original%20Medicare.)
at risk.

**In their own words:**

Medicare

regulations restrict choice

of coverage and care. The

next Administration should

reintroduce and restore

regulations and demonstrations

from the Trump Administration

that were withdrawn, weakened,

or never finalized by the Biden

Administration

"

***Mandate for Leadership p. 463***

**4 How they'd do it:**

> Make it easier for extremists to access personal information about
> patients' reproductive care. Project 2025 would remove protections the
> Biden administration put in place post-*Dobbs* to protect the personal
> information of people who receive reproductive care.

In the immediate aftermath of the *Dobbs* decision that overturned *Roe
v. Wade*, the Biden administration issued HIPAA
[**[guidance]{.underline}**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/08/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-protecting-access-to-reproductive-health-care-services/)
to "ensure doctors and other medical providers and health plans know
that, with limited exceptions, they are not required -- and in many
cases, are not permitted -- to disclose patients' private information,
including to law enforcement." The administration later finalized a
[**[rule]{.underline}**](https://apnews.com/article/abortion-medical-records-privacy-hipaa-biden-07d3419f3d44050af71de3b3536e3938)
to shield the medical records of patients from criminal investigations
if they cross state lines to seek an abortion where it is legal.

Even as extremists in
[**[Texas]{.underline}**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2024/05/03/texas-abortion-investigations/)
actively try to use the courts to access information about people
receiving abortions out of state, Project 2025 claims that the Biden
administration's privacy guidance is "fear mongering" and would have a
future administration withdraw it. As more states move to pass
increasingly severe efforts to criminalize abortion, this would put

**2 How they'd do it:**

The special interests behind Project 2025 want to reverse the
longstanding body of work by civil rights activists who have encouraged
the federal government to collect more sophisticated data when it comes
to racial and ethnic groups, which has helped ensure communities that
have been historically under-resourced because of their racial
demographics receive proper allocations of resources.

As recently as March 2024, the Biden administration issued a revision to
[**[Statistical]{.underline}** **[Directive
No.15]{.underline}**](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/03/29/2024-06469/revisions-to-ombs-statistical-policy-directive-no-15-standards-for-maintaining-collecting-and#:~:text=The%20goals%20of%20SPD%2015%20remain%20unchanged%3A%20to%20ensure%20the,collecting%20the%20data%20are%20consistent.),
which governs "standards for maintaining, collecting, and presenting
federal data on race and ethnicity." The revision is for more accurate
and useful race and ethnicity data collection across various agencies of
the U.S. federal government.

> **In their own words:** Review forthcoming changes to race and
> ethnicity questions. The current Administration has announced its
> intent to change data collection methods regarding race and ethnicity
> by combining the two questions on the decennial questionnaire and
> increasing the number of available options. A new conservative
> Administration should take control of this process and thoroughly
> review any changes." ***Mandate for Leadership p. 680***

Project 2025 would advise a future administration to hamstring these
revisions by instructing the White House Office of Management and Budget
to reverse them and ensure that other federal agencies are not aiding in
the collection of more accurate data. This would leave historically
underrepresented communities at a disadvantage when it comes to
accessing critical programs we rely on every day --- from Medicaid to
Head Start.

3.  **How they'd do it:**

> Undermine gender equity across the government.
>
> Project 2025 would eliminate the White House Gender Policy Council,
> which is key to promoting contraception access, gender-based violence
> prevention, and women's health equity.

***From Mandate for Leadership p. 62***

Under the Biden administration, the White House Gender Policy Council
has led efforts to increase access to
[**[contraception]{.underline}**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/gpc/briefing-room/2024/02/29/strengthening-access-to-contraception-at-pharmacies/),
published the [**[National Plan to End]{.underline}** **[Gender-Based
Violence]{.underline}**,](https://www.whitehouse.gov/gpc/briefing-room/2023/05/25/release-of-the-national-plan-to-end-gender-based-violence-strategies-for-action/)
and begun groundbreaking research into how [**[women's]{.underline}**
**[health]{.underline}**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/gpc/briefing-room/2023/11/17/launch-of-white-house-initiative-on-womens-health-research/)
is studied across the country. Project 2025 would immediately disband
the Council and prioritize coordinating efforts that push for "promoting
life" and emphasize a narrow vision of what defines a "family."

4.  **How they'd do it:**

> Allow more discrimination against LGBTQ+ youth in adoption and foster
> care agencies. Project 2025 would make it easier for state and child

> way to promote bigotry.

In 2022, more than [**[368,000 children were
enrolled]{.underline}**](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cb/afcars-report-30.pdf)
in foster care in the U.S. Project 2025 would instruct the Department of
Health and Human Services to repeal a 2016 regulation that provides
additional protections for foster youth, related to sexual orientation
and gender identity.

Enabling adoption and foster care agencies to subject vulnerable
children to the whims of extreme religious beliefs would be detrimental
to the physical, mental, and emotional health of fostered/adopted youth,
especially LGBTQ+ youth, who are already dealing with intense
adversities.

***From Mandate for Leadership p. 477***

5.  **How they'd do it:**

> Put Black communities and others that have historically borne the
> brunt of health impacts from pollution and other environmental harms
> at increased risk. Project 2025 proposes to eliminate the EPA's Office
> of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights.

EPA's newly-created Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil
Rights is the agency's dedicated office for ensuring that environmental
and public health policies are crafted and implemented in ways that
ensure no communities are left behind or disproportionately harmed.

Eliminating this office would put the communities that have historically
borne the brunt of harms from pollution, climate change, and other
hazards --- which are too often Black and brown
[**[communities]{.underline}**](https://psci.princeton.edu/tips/2020/8/15/racial-disparities-and-climate-change)
--- at increased risk.

6.  **How they'd do it:**

> Enable discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
> By misinterpreting Supreme Court precedent and allowing more religious
> exemptions, Project 2025 would roll back protections against
> discrimination against LGBTQ+ people and others in the workplace.

LGBTQ+ Americans have had to fight for protections under the law and in
recent years we have witnessed important gains, including the Supreme
Court's confirmation of federal protections in the workplace, which
logically extend to other areas like health care and schools. Yet,
Project 2025 wants to reverse this progress.

Project 2025 plans to restrict the application of a critical 2020
Supreme Court case called *Bostock v. Clayton County* that assures
workplace protections for LGBTQ+ people through making clear that
discrimination against LGBTQ+ people is a form of sex discrimination
prohibited by our federal civil rights laws. Project 2025 would try to
enable greater workplace discrimination through allowing employers to
impose their religious or moral beliefs on their employees.

Additionally, the Biden administration has helped to ensure protections
from gender identity discrimination across many aspects of our lives,
[**[including]{.underline}**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/31/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-advances-equality-and-visibility-for-transgender-americans/)
"health care, housing, education, credit and lending services, and
community safety programs."

Project 2025, however, would roll back and severely limit those
protections and leave already-vulnerable people at increased risk for
discrimination when trying to rent an apartment, go to school, and more.

***From Mandate for Leadership p. 425***

**How they'd do it:**

Cut off weather, ocean, and climate data by

disbanding NOAA.

Project 2025 would disband

the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric

Administration (NOAA), which provides critical

weather data and insightful scientific research.

**2**

The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) plays a
critical role in helping us understand the effects of human behavior on
the world's oceans and atmosphere. NOAA
[**[issues]{.underline}**](https://www.noaa.gov/about-our-agency) "daily
weather forecasts," "severe storm warnings," and more. It also monitors
the climate, manages fisheries, restores coastal environments, and
supports marine commerce. According to
[**[NOAA]{.underline}**,](https://www.noaa.gov/about-our-agency) the
agency's "products and services support economic vitality and affect
more than one-third of America's gross domestic product."

**In their own words:**

The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric

Administration (NOAA) should be dismantled and many of its functions

eliminated, sent to other agencies, privatized, or placed under the

control of states and territories.

"

***Mandate for Leadership p. 664***

**How they'd do it:**

Transfer environmental funding

away from mission-based entities

to state regulators who, in many

cases, do not support sustainable

policies.

Project 2025 seeks to

undo progress made through the

Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) by

any means necessary.

**3**

Additionally, NOAA's reports have made important discoveries about the
effects of climate change. NOAA's expertise is [**[frequently relied
on]{.underline}**](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/climate-change)
by other federal agencies to "understand how they can respond to and
adapt to climate change."

The proposal to disband NOAA would leave federal agencies unequipped to
combat climate change, not to mention deprive scientists, businesses,
and the public of key data.

The IRA creates ambitious and expansive investment in climate action and
infrastructure development, and is a top target of Project 2025. Even
without new legislation, Project 2025 advocates to shift climate-related
IRA funds away from mission-based organizations with subject matter
expertise and toward state regulatory entities. This would, in our
estimation, allow state leaders not committed to climate sustainability
(or those who deny climate change altogether) to misuse funds in a way
that would set back climate action.

***From Mandate for Leadership p. 424***

**How they'd do it:**

Expand offshore oil and natural gas drilling on public

lands and waters.

Project 2025 would push the

gas lease sales "to the maximum extent permitted."

The groups behind the Mandate for Leadership want to "conduct offshore
oil and natural gas lease sales to the maximum extent permitted."

Pendley, a former Trump administration official who had to [**[recuse
himself]{.underline}**](https://www.tester.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/pr-7796/)
from dozens of matters before the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) while
he was leading it, due to flagrant conflicts of interest as the former
president of a special interest organization that called for the
widespread transfer of federal public lands to private holders. Not only
that, Pendley has [**[referred to climate science as
'junk]{.underline}** **[science' and likened the existence of climate
change to unicorns.]{.underline}**](https://conservationco.org/pendley/)

This proposal would allow fossil fuel companies to drill on more public

Of the 2.2 million federal employees, [**[most already do not work in
Washington,]{.underline}**
**[D.C.]{.underline}**](https://democracyforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CivilServiceReport_DemocracyForward_FINAL.pdf)
Still, we know that many of our nation's foremost experts in their
respective fields are situated in Washington, D.C., serving the American
people every day at federal agencies.

In 2019, the Trump administration relocated the Bureau of Land
Management (BLM) to Colorado, resulting in
[**[77%]{.underline}**](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-104247.pdf#page=19)
of the bureau's employees resigning from their positions.

If federal agencies are relocated without thoughtful consideration and
public input, critical agencies could lose major sects of their labor
force, limiting the ability of the federal government to deliver for the
people it is meant to serve.

**How they'd do it:**

They would also utilize legislative or regulatory processes ---

the usage of general intelligence tests, which have not been in use

that the general intelligence exam (the Professional and Administration

Judging prospective candidates for federal employment in ideological or
discriminatory ways is a dangerous way to govern. People across the U.S.

that does provide some due process rights for those whose clearances are
revoked. Project 2025, however, would encourage a future administration
to "remove IC (intelligence community) employees" under vague criteria
that risk increased politicization.

In addition to revoking clearances, Project 2025 would empower the
Director of National Intelligence and the Director of the Central
Intelligence Agency to expedite the issuance of security clearances to
those deemed necessary to meet the administration's "mission needs."

Expediting the issuance of security clearances paves way for more
unqualified and inept leaders to be charged with our nation's most
sensitive national security matters. Take Jared Kushner: when two
national expert security specialists refused to issue him a clearance
(due to concerns of foreign influence over him), the Trump
administration

their expertise and gave him one anyway.
